                                <p>While it is expected that you will be traveling to Ralos, that information may not be known in advance by the identity you are likely to assume.

                                        The High Gorrethian Kingdom is an interstellar species about which the Romulan Republic knows little.
                                        It is in the interest of your assumed identity to learn more about them to report back to the senator in 
                                        order to better understand Starfleet's interests in rumored negotiations with them.

                                    Little is known about this particular sister of the Qowat Milat which would have been likely provided to the identity you will assume.
                                    Consequently, it would be in your best interest to learn what you can about them. Know the common traits of the Qowat Milat include
                                    honesty, directness, surety of purpose, and a willingness to cut down anyone or anything that stands between them and the one to whom 
                                    they have sworn their blade. In this case, it is anticipated but "unconfirmed" that this Qowat Milat will be taking action on behalf of 
                                    either the Gorrethian Takanet Armun'he.

                                        A native of Valcaria and former member of T'virikhan's crew, Hatham has reenlisted to serve on the
                                        warbird again. He is a pilot for the House and is on the roster for shuttle pilots that occasionally serve the senator's
                                        office.

                                        This "shuttle pilot" is responsible for bringing you and your partner to Starbase 432 in the Wayfarer Expanse. Your skills both

                                        for which you are a ready volunteer. Having heard from an aide to the senator the plight of the Gorrethian, you were ordered in secret
                                        to personally see to the well-being of the Qowat Milat, to serve as a back up pilot for her crew, and to provide protection for Takanet's
                                        beloved whom we need returned alive in order to ensure that the Gorrethian Kingdom's leverage is in more trustworthy hands.

                                    While not officially on Ailak's security team, Ejiul's activities say another story. Some records indicate that the

                                    may consider them a disposable agent, but their long history of service suggests that their skills have not
                                    degraded.

                                <h3>Full name: Ailak ir-Valcaria e-nRehfirh tr'Stelravas</h3>
                                
                                <h3>Commonly used name: Deihu Ailak tr'Stelravas</h3>

                                <h3>Position: Senator</h3>
                                
                                    <p>House s'Stelravas were a wealthy but not politically important house before the supernova, notable for patroning
                                    underprivileged artists and scientists. Ailak married in from Unsa'avit clan s'nRehfirh, a scandal at the time, to
                                    strengthen the House with Noble Born blood. He was known mostly as Commander of the exploratory warbird T'virikhan,
                                    which saw battle during the turbulent 2370s. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Less-secret-now, many of the House's retainers had Unificationist or other
                                    dissident ties. When rumor of the supernova first hit the Senate, he used T'virikhan to evacuate as many of his people
                                    as possible against orders. As a result, the House survived the supernova with clan and client bloc intact, went rogue
                                    (confirming rumors of dissident ties), and became politically significant in one swoop. He currently represents their
                                    new settlement on Mol'Rihan, but has handed duties off to a young relative of his wife who is expected to be his
                                    successor to the Senate.</p> 
                                    
                                    <p>It is a badly-kept secret that he plans to retire to command a ship again, and he has poured
                                    most of his time, energy, and finances into an expensive refit. "Ship-Clan T'virikhan" (as it is jokingly called but not
                                    to Ailak's face) is not likely to remain on Mol'Rihan for long. Those who know Ailak personally are struck by his
                                    singleminded devotion to the stars and romanticism about the Sundering and Exodus, which some consider to be misplaced.</p>

                                    <p>A common thread for this senator is that he employs family and those who served under him on the T'virikhan. 
                                    If there is ambiguity about how you came to know the senator, service is the place to start.</p>
